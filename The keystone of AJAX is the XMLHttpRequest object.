The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.

The XMLHttpRequest Object
All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.

The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.


AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with server-side scripts. It can send as well as receive information in a variety of formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and even text files. AJAXâ€™s most appealing characteristic, however, is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can do all of this without having to refresh the page. This lets you update portions of a page based upon user events.

The two features in question are that you can:

Make requests to the server without reloading the page
Receive and work with data from the server
