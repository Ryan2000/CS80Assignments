        // Write a script that simulates a soda vending machine. Your script
        // will do the following:
        // 1. Declare a variable called sodaPrice and set it to the value 2.
        // 2. Display to the user the price of a soda using an alert.
        // 3. Prompt the user for how many sodas they wish to buy.
        // 4. Prompt the user for how much money they want to insert.
        // 5. Compute the change that should be returned to the user.
        // 6. Display the results (using document.write or document.writeln):
        //      price, sodas bought, money inserted, and change returned
        //
        // Note: if you like, you may assume that the user will always input at
        // least enough money to purchase the sodas that were requested, and 
        // that all values inserted by the user will be positive integers.
